In the popular Pokémon games all moves and Pokémons have types that determine how effective certain moves are against certain Pokémons.
These work by some very simple rules, a certain type can be super effective, normal, not very effective or have no effect at all against another type.
These translate respectively to 2x, 1x, 0.5x and 0x damage multiplication.
If a Pokémon has multiple types the effectiveness of a move against this Pokémon will be the product of the effectiveness of the move to it's types.
